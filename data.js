    tagline:'We squeezed the most into it. And out of it.',
    explanation: 'Each component inside MacBook has been meticulously designed to get the most out of an incredibly thin and light enclosure. We chose powerful yet highly efficient processors, and optimized macOS to draw on the processor using as little power as possible. Because no fan is needed to cool the computer, it has more room for battery cells to support you on the go, all day long.'
